# Allow ring 0.16.20 AES overflow vulnerability
# This is a transitive dependency through: rcgen -> x509-parser -> ring
# The issue is an AES panic when overflow checking is enabled,
# which doesn't affect our certificate generation use case.
# We'll upgrade when rcgen/x509-parser update to ring 0.17+
