# Clippy Configuration for KeelOS
# This file defines the linting rules for the entire workspace.
# See: https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/configuration.html

# Warn on all wildcard imports to maintain explicit dependencies
warn-on-all-wildcard-imports = true

# Set a reasonable cognitive complexity threshold
# PID 1 and agent code should be simple and maintainable
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 15

# Ensure error handling is explicit
# This helps prevent accidental unwraps in PID 1 code
# Note: allow-unwrap-in-tests and allow-expect-in-tests are controlled via workspace.lints in Cargo.toml
